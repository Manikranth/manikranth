## 🧙‍♂️ Reliability engineer because even computers need therapy sometimes

I speak fluent YAML and dream in Terraform. Building the digital highways of tomorrow with more 9s than you can count. Breaking things so users don't have to. 🛠️

> "The cloud is just someone else's computer, but with way cooler stickers on it"

### 🔮 What I'm cooking up these days
- Teaching Kubernetes pods to play nice with each other (it's like digital kindergarten)
- Making networks go zoom when everyone else's go boom
- Building dashboards so pretty they belong in digital art galleries
- Turning coffee into automated infrastructure (greatest engineering feat ever)
- Training AI models that actually understand my infrastructure jokes

### 💼 Places I've left my digital fingerprints
- **PwC** - Digital firefighter and chaos prevention specialist
- **Coinbase** - The "no, you can't deploy that" enforcer
- **FedEx** - Cloud whisperer and packet wrangler

### 🎓 Things I learned while avoiding real life
- **Eastern Michigan University** - They gave me a fancy paper saying I know stuff
- **JB Institute** - Where I first learned computers are just rocks we tricked into thinking
- **AWS Certification** - Proof I can navigate Amazon's services better than their own website
- **Azure** - Because one cloud wasn't complicated enough

## 🤖 AI Adventures & Experiments

When I'm not keeping infrastructure from imploding, I'm teaching machines to do my bidding:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <a href="https://github.com/Manikranth/PromptCraft-AI">
        <b>🧠 PromptCraft-AI</b>
      </a>
      <br>
      Where I convince AI to do my work so I can watch cat videos. My experiments with prompt engineering and LLM optimization that occasionally produce something useful!
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <a href="https://github.com/Manikranth/RSVP-website">
        <b>🎉 RSVP-website</b>
      </a>
      <br>
      A smart event RSVP system with AI-powered suggestions - because even your party planning deserves machine learning assistance (and I got tired of counting responses manually).
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <a href="https://github.com/Manikranth/Project_Eve">
        <b>👁️ Project_Eve</b>
      </a>
      <br>
      My digital assistant experiment that's only slightly less judgmental than HAL 9000. Explores natural language processing and conversational AI without the existential dread.

## 🏗️ Digital Sandcastles I've Built

<details>
  <summary><b>🔍 "Why Is It Always DNS?" Monitoring Platform</b></summary>
  <p>
    <b>The Dream:</b> A system that tells you why everything is broken before your users start tweeting about it.<br>
    <b>Magical Ingredients:</b> Prometheus (for when numbers matter), Grafana (for pretty colors), Loki (for reading logs without crying), Tempo (because tracing is cool now)<br>
    <b>Special Powers:</b> Predicts outages through the mystical art of "pattern recognition," sends alerts that actually make sense, and occasionally makes educated guesses about which config change broke everything this time
  </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>🌩️ The "It Works On My Cloud" Deployment Pipeline</b></summary>
  <p>
    <b>The Dream:</b> Code travels magically from developer laptops to production without anyone staying up all night.<br>
    <b>Magical Ingredients:</b> ArgoCD (for Kubernetes whispering), Terraform (for infrastructure poetry), GitHub Actions (for automation magic)<br>
    <b>Special Powers:</b> Deploys code while you're at lunch, rolls back changes before anyone notices they were bad, and maintains a perfect audit trail of who to blame when things go sideways
  </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>🛡️ The "You Shall Not Pass!" Security Framework</b></summary>
  <p>
    <b>The Dream:</b> Making security teams and developers fight less at company happy hours.<br>
    <b>Magical Ingredients:</b> Open Policy Agent (the digital bouncer), Rego (the language only four people understand), Terraform (because rebuilding is easier than fixing)<br>
    <b>Special Powers:</b> Automatically rejects bad security practices, generates compliance reports that make auditors smile, and occasionally predicts security breaches through dark magic and statistical analysis
  </p>
</details>

## 🧠 Currently Adding To My Techno-Wizardry

- ⚙️ Service Mesh spells (or "how to make microservices even more complicated")
- 🔍 eBPF incantations (because regular observability is too mainstream)
- 🤖 Prompt engineering (teaching robots to understand my sarcasm)
- 🧮 Neural network architecture (building digital brains that occasionally work)
- 🔒 Zero Trust security (trust issues, but for computers)
